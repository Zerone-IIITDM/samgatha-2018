	              Depression (major depressive disorder) is a common and serious medical illness that negatively affects how you feel, the way you think and how you act. Fortunately, it is also treatable. Depression causes feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities once enjoyed. It can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems and can decrease a personâ€™s ability to function at work and at home.

	            	SNEHA is a voluntary, non-religious, non-political organisation which runs a 24-hour hotline to help the distressed, depressed and suicidal. They are entirely run by volunteers and operate solely on public donations. Through this fundraiser, we aim to spread the message about both the foundation and our college/fest as a small part of the proceeds will go into funding SAMGATHA.
